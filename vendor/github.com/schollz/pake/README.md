This library will help you allow two parties to generate a mutual secret key by using a weak key that is known to both beforehand (e.g. via some other channel of communication). This is a simple API for an implementation of password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE). This protocol is derived from [Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup's cryptography book](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/BonehShoup_0_4.pdf) (pg 789, "PAKE2 protocol). I decided to create this library so I could use PAKE in my file-transfer utility, [croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc).


## Install

```
go get -u github.com/schollz/pake
```

## Usage 

![Explanation of algorithm](https://i.imgur.com/s7oQWVP.png)

```golang
// pick an elliptic curve
curve := elliptic.P224() 
// both parties should have a weak key
pw := []byte{1, 2, 3}

// initialize sender P ("0" indicates sender)
P, err := Init(pw, 0, curve)
check(err)

// initialize recipient Q ("1" indicates recipient)
Q, err := Init(pw, 1, curve)
check(err)

// first, P sends u to Q
err = Q.Update(P.Bytes())
check(err) // errors will occur when any part of the process fails

// Q computes k, sends H(k), v back to P
err = P.Update(Q.Bytes())
check(err)

// P computes k, H(k), sends H(k) to Q
err = Q.Update(P.Bytes())
check(err)

// both P and Q now have session key
k := P.SessionKey()
```

The *H(k)* is a bcrypt hashed session key, which only the keeper of a real session key can verify. Passing this between P and Q allows them to understand that the other party does indeed have the session key derived correctly through the PAKE protocol. The session key can then be used to encrypt a message because it has never passed between parties.

When passing *P* and *Q* back and forth, the structure is being marshalled using `Bytes()`, which prevents any private variables from being accessed from either party.

Each function has an error. The error become non-nil when some part of the algorithm fails verification: i.e. the points are not along the elliptic curve, or if a hash from either party is not identified. If this happens, you should abort and start a new PAKE transfer as it would have been compromised.
